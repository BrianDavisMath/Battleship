# Battleship
This Python script is a simple version of the board game Battleship for one player.
The pre-trained AI opponent tries to guess the most likely grid square to contain one of your ships.
The AI improves the more you play. Out of the box it's good enough to beat me and my wife if we aren't really trying :)
